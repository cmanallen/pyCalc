##A Python Calculator
####Made by Colton Allen

This project is just a test at creating algorithms and performing stack operations.

This calculator can handle all of the follow operators:

1. +

2. -

3. /

4. *

5. ^

6. (

7. )


This calculator preserves the order of operations.
So:
> 10 * ( 5 + 5 ) =/= 55
And:
> 10 + 5 * 5 =/= 75

When using the calculator you must space seperate your values.  E.g. ( 5 + 5 ) or ( 1 * 2 - ( 3 + 4 ) / 5 ).

This calculator does not understand that 2 ( 5 + 5 ) means 2 * ( 5 + 5 ).  You must explicitly state it.  Between every number should be an operator or a parenthesis.
